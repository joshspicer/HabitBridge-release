HabitBridge collects no personal data whatsoever. There is no use of telemetry or trackers employed by the app developer.

All application data resides on-device, unless you enable the webhook feature.  If you enable the webhook feature, data will be sent to the HTTP/HTTPS address you specify.

Limited outbound network access to the internet is utilized for fetching plugins built by the developer or the community.  This plugin index is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement) and accessed anonymously from the application.  This static website is [open source](https://github.com/joshspicer/HabitBridgeMarketplace) and the URL is configurable by the user in the application's settings.

This page will be updated with any amendments to the privacy policy. We reserve the right to update this privacy policy with subsequent app updates.
